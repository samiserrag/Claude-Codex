# Collaboration State

## Goal

Prove a practical two-way Claude Code <-> Codex collaboration loop in this repo.
The sample build is a small static Decision Ledger app.

## Current Owner

Codex (E3-B trust-bootstrap implementation spike, authorized by Sami
on 2026-05-15; concurrently authorized: E3-C read-only adapter
inspection)

## Current Phase

E3-B authorized by Sami on 2026-05-15 as a trust-bootstrap-only
implementation spike. Explicit authorization text recorded in this
COLLAB.md entry and the consultation thread:

  "Approved: run E3-B as a trust-bootstrap-only implementation spike.
  Scope:
  - File-based reference path only.
  - No live transport, cron, webhook, plugin, MCP bridge, installs,
    global config changes, commits, pushes, PRs, or branches.
  - First add/verify secret-safety protection: create or update
    .gitignore only as needed so .agent-handoff/local/ is ignored.
  - Before creating/importing any private key, verify:
    git check-ignore .agent-handoff/local/keys/sami-root.ed25519
  - Use a single-developer per-repo Sami root key for this prototype.
  - Private key path: .agent-handoff/local/keys/sami-root.ed25519,
    untracked and ignored.
  - Public trust material may be written under .agent-handoff/trust/
    and signed events under .agent-handoff/events/.
  - Address all seven E3-A critique nits in the E3-B turn note.
  - Hard stop after E3-B and hand off to Claude for critique."

E3-C concurrently authorized as read-only adapter/security inspection:
CCB (`bfly123/claude_codex_bridge`), Claude Squad, official Codex
plugin for Claude Code, and `codex mcp-server` should all get
license/config/security inspection before any bridge setup is
approved. E3-C must stay read-only and must not block E3-B.

Critical local finding noted by Sami: this repo currently has no
`.gitignore`. Step zero of E3-B is creating/updating `.gitignore` and
verifying via `git check-ignore` before any private key is generated.

Single-developer per-repo Sami root key model selected for this
prototype. Org/team signing path deferred to a later design.

Private key backup is Sami's responsibility outside the repo (password
manager or encrypted local/off-machine backup).

Seven E3-A critique nits to address in E3-B's turn note: time skew
window default, integer-only-numbers rule scope for payloads,
`recipient_coordinator_ids` broadcast semantics, `possession_proof_hash`
byte format, replay-vs-import nonce semantics, branch/force-push
policy, prompt-injection minimum baseline.

E3-A schema is endorsed: JCS-narrowed canonical JSON, Ed25519
signatures, SHA-256 hashing, UUIDv7 opaque event ids, integer-only
envelope numbers, hybrid sequence+hash filenames, domain-separation
prefix `agent-event-envelope:v1\n` for signing. Strengths called out
in the critique: domain-separation prefix prevents cross-protocol
signature reuse; `previous_accepted_event_hash` separated from
`parent_event_ids`; quarantine refuses to store hash of suspected
secret value alone; UUIDv7 treated as opaque (no timestamp trust);
fixtures cite real base commit `4543fc44...`.

E3-A was authorized by Sami on 2026-05-15. Explicit authorization text
recorded in this COLLAB.md entry and the consultation thread:

  "Run E3-A as a design-only event-envelope schema/spec turn. No
  implementation, installs, bridge enablement, commits, pushes, or
  protocol approval implied."

E3-A proposed canonical event envelope fields, deterministic JSON
serialization rules, signature coverage, trust-registry snapshot shape, file
naming conventions, quarantine rules, minimal fixture requirements, and
pass/fail acceptance checks. Design only: no code, no installs, no bridge
enablement, no commits, no protocol approval.

Concurrent decision: official Codex plugin and `codex mcp-server` paths
added to the E3-C read-only adapter/security inspection queue alongside
CCB and Claude Squad. Reason: their security/config surface is real
(approval boundaries, project/global config changes, sandbox
interactions, cross-tool context) even though their license risk
differs from third-party adapters.

Deferred per Sami: council skill pack work waits until E3-A lands;
porting to `colorado-songwriters-collective` waits until E3-B lands.
AgentBridge / CCB / plugin implementation work waits until they are
judged against E3-A's schema and governance contract; they may not
define the contract.

(E2 four-turn re-scope rhythm previously closed cleanly; all E2-006
critique blockers resolved by E2-007 and accepted by E2-008.)

`COLLAB.md` remains transitional pending the new state model.

Hard stop: E3-B and E3-C are authorized as scoped above. Codex is the
authoring agent for both (mirroring E2-001/E2-003/E3-A). Claude
consultant is the next critique agent for both. No bridge enablement,
installs, commits, pushes, PRs, branches, global config changes, or
proposed-to-approved transitions in either turn — E3-B writes
implementation files within scope; E3-C writes a read-only inspection
turn note only.

## Tool Observations

- Codex CLI is installed: `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, `codex-cli 0.130.0`.
- Claude Code is installed: `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, `2.1.58`.
- `codex mcp-server --help` works.
- `claude mcp serve --help` works.
- Claude currently has the Vercel plugin installed, but not the OpenAI Codex
  plugin.
- `claude mcp list` currently reports only a Vercel MCP entry and that health
  check fails.
- No project-level Claude MCP entry for Codex has been confirmed yet.
- Browser runner setup is Chrome-first. Do not default to Playwright.
- Chrome health checks passed: Chrome is installed and running; the Codex Chrome
  Extension is installed/enabled; the Codex Chrome native host manifest is
  correct.
- Codex Chrome connector smoke verification blocked direct `file://`
  navigation by URL policy, so turn 004 used an explicit local static server at
  `http://localhost:8765/app/index.html` and stopped it after verification.
- `denver-songwriters-collective` is the old repo name. Use
  `colorado-songwriters-collective` for current sibling-repo references.
- Ubicloud runner clarification: the CI runner provider is Ubicloud. The
  console project is `pj0qdnp2x6fp4q5p24j13cqv81`; the console shows the
  `samiserrag` GitHub integration and no active runners at setup time.
- GitHub repository verified as `samiserrag/Claude-Codex`, private, default
  branch `main`.

## E1 Historical Constraints / Still-Active Approval Stopgates

- Do not install dependencies without Sami's explicit approval.
- Do not commit, push, merge, or create a PR without Sami's explicit approval.
- Do not use dangerous sandbox or approval-bypass modes.
- Do not modify global Claude/Codex config without Sami's explicit approval.
- Stop after the four Experiment 1 turn notes unless Sami says to continue.

## E1 Historical Decisions Made

- Use repo files as the source of truth for collaboration state.
- Use a no-dependency static web app as the sample project.
- Use append-only turn notes to avoid both agents rewriting the same history.
- Run Experiment 1 file-based only. Do not use an MCP/plugin bridge in the
  first loop.
- Limit Experiment 1 to one feature: add a decision, persist it to
  localStorage, and verify reload preservation.
- Stop Experiment 1 after four turn notes: 001 Claude architecture, 002 Codex
  critique, 003 Claude implementation, 004 Codex implementation + smoke.
- Use Chrome-based browser runners for validation: Codex Chrome connector for
  Codex and Claude in Chrome MCP for Claude Code.
- Use Ubicloud for GitHub Actions CI via `runs-on: ubicloud-standard-2`.

## E1 Historical Considered And Rejected

- Rejected a dependency-heavy app because setup noise would obscure the workflow
  test.
- Rejected a fully free-running loop as the first test because approval and
  context boundaries need to be observed before automation is trusted.
- Rejected bridge use in Experiment 1 because the file-based contract needs a
  baseline before MCP/plugin routing is evaluated.
- Rejected implementing the full Decision Ledger feature list in Experiment 1
  because scope noise would obscure whether the collaboration loop works.

## E1 Historical Proposed File Ownership

- Claude owns turn 001 architecture, `app/index.html`, and first-pass
  `app/styles.css`.
- Codex owns turn 002 critique, `app/app.js`, and Chrome smoke evidence.
- Both agents may update `.agent-handoff/COLLAB.md` and add turn notes.
- Neither agent should edit another agent's existing turn note.
- Experiment 1 no-touch files after this setup pass: `.github/`, `.claude/`,
  `docs/`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.agent-handoff/PROTOCOL.md`.

  consultant critique before further E3 work.

## Latest Claude Response

E2-007 rescope revision written at
`.agent-handoff/turns/E2-007-claude-rescope-revision.md` accepting all
three E2-006 blockers. (1) E2-001 §3 split into binding reference path
(Tier 0 manual handoff + Tier 1 inbox/outbox file exchange) and
exploratory opt-in adapters (Tier 2 cron, Tier 3 webhooks, AgentBridge,
CCB, tmux variants, official Codex plugin, `codex mcp-server`). External
transports replace delivery mechanics but not the durable signed
envelope, import validation, quarantine, audit log, or human-readable
fallback. (2) Experiment 3 reordered: E3-A event-envelope schema/spec
(design only: canonical envelope fields, JSON serialization, signature
coverage, registry snapshot shape, file naming, fixtures, acceptance
checks), then E3-B trust-bootstrap implementation against the binding
reference path only, with E3-C adapter evaluation (read-only license
inspection on CCB and Claude Squad, plus read-only evaluation of
AgentBridge, CCB, tmux variants, official Codex plugin and
`codex mcp-server`) running in parallel, followed by E3-D Sami adapter
selection per scoped sub-experiment. (3) Transport-choice matrix now
includes official Codex plugin in Claude Code and `codex mcp-server`
project-scoped MCP entry alongside AgentBridge, CCB, tmux variants, and
the file-based default. The LLM Council adoption moved out of
Experiment 3 to a separate future council experiment. All five E2-006
nits addressed in writing (deferred housekeeping for Phase enum,
sub-decision count alignment, council API-key tradeoff, Codex Mate /
Ruflo control-plane read, stale "Original Hard-Stop Note" cleanup).

## Earlier Claude Response

E2-005 re-scope written at `.agent-handoff/turns/E2-005-claude-rescope.md`
after round-3 prior-art consultation. Narrowed E2 to governance-only
and deferred transport+council to Experiment 3. Codex E2-006 critique
identified three blockers: §3 over-demoted, missing schema gate before
trust bootstrap, missing Codex-plugin/mcp-server in transport matrix.
All three accepted and addressed by E2-007.

## Latest Codex Response

E3-A schema/spec written at
`.agent-handoff/turns/E3-A-codex-envelope-schema.md`. Codex proposes a strict
`agent-event-envelope.v1` JSON envelope with required fields for repo identity,
branch, base commit, experiment namespace, event id, coordinator id, author
role, parent event ids, per-coordinator sequence, timestamp, nonce, payload
hash, previous accepted event hash, signing key id, Ed25519 algorithm,
payload, and signature. Canonical bytes are proposed as an RFC 8785
JCS-compatible deterministic subset; signatures cover a domain-separation
prefix plus canonical JSON with only the `signature` field omitted. The turn
also proposes the signed `agents.json` trust-registry snapshot shape,
sequence-plus-hash file naming for events/inbox/outbox/trust/quarantine/local
state, quarantine triggers and redaction rules, minimal fixture requirements,
and import/replay/quarantine pass/fail checks. The schema is not approved
protocol. No code, installs, bridge enablement, git operations, global config
changes, protocol edits, trust files, keys, event directories, or automation
were created.

## Earlier Codex Response

Turn 002 critique written at `.agent-handoff/turns/002-codex-critique.md`.
Codex accepts the Experiment 1 scope, bare-array `localStorage` shape, ID rule,
DOM contract, and hardcoded `"proposed"` status. Codex listed one blocker:
write-failure behavior must not render or treat a new decision as saved when
`localStorage.setItem` fails, because that would violate the reload-preserves
promise. The required correction is to attempt the storage write against a
candidate list first, then update in-memory state and render only after the
write succeeds. Nits cover ARIA linkage, locale timestamp rendering, and
keeping parse-failure recovery simple.

## Questions Requiring Sami Approval

- None active for E3-A until Claude's critique returns. Any move from the
  proposed schema to approved protocol still requires Sami's explicit
  approval.
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we install the official OpenAI
  Codex plugin in Claude Code?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we register `codex mcp-server`
  as a project-scoped Claude MCP server?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we register `claude mcp serve`
  inside Codex for the reverse-direction experiment?

## Next Request To Claude

Perform the E3-A architecture-consultant critique of
`.agent-handoff/turns/E3-A-codex-envelope-schema.md`. Focus on deterministic
serialization, signature coverage, trust-registry snapshot shape,
replay/quarantine behavior, filename conventions, and whether the minimal
fixture contract is concrete enough for E3-B implementation. Do not implement,
install dependencies, enable bridges, edit global config, commit, push, open a
PR, create event directories, create keys, or treat any proposed schema item
as approved.

## Next Request To Codex

None active. Hard stop after E3-A until Claude's critique is filed and Sami
explicitly authorizes any next scope.

## Next Request To Sami

None immediate unless you want to redirect the experiment. The next expected
action is Claude's E3-A critique.
