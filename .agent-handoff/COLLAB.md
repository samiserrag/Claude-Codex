# Collaboration State

## Goal

Prove a practical two-way Claude Code <-> Codex collaboration loop in this repo.
The sample build is a small static Decision Ledger app.

## Current Owner

Sami (E3-D-FIX-001 acceptance + next E3 step decision)

## Current Phase

E3-D-FIX-001 Claude consultant critique filed (2026-05-15). Zero
blockers. All five wrapper-precondition nits resolved with the
precision required for future enablement scoping. Notable
strengths called out: honest acknowledgment of self-measurement
limits in Nit 5; the "may not attest to" enumeration in Nit 2;
fsync ordering specified explicitly in Nit 4; complete escalation
ladder with no silent-failure mode; correct discipline in flagging
`coordinator_purpose` and `allowed_attestation_modes` as future
schema work rather than silent application.

Codex's five open questions answered: yes to separate prior trust
turn for wrapper coordinator registration; `wrapper-codex-mcp` id
acceptable for prototype with future per-transport convention to
follow when second adapter is scoped; yes to payload-only
`attested_by_observer` (no top-level schema expansion); yes to the
three approval-durability tests (with consultant recommending a
fourth concurrent-approval test for future enablement); yes to
signed identity manifest + startup measurement for first prototype
with explicit limitation correctly documented.

Five small nits flagged for future direct-MCP enablement
sub-experiment (NOT for E3-D-FIX-001 acceptance):
1. Add concurrent-approval test alongside the three Codex named.
2. Coordinator-id taxonomy question (per-transport vs single
   wrapper-codex with payload distinction) — defer to second
   adapter selection or new naming-convention turn.
3. Read-only/status-only fallback requires architectural
   separation of duties between approval-emission and observation.
4. Diagnostic events overload `message.created`; future event-kind
   choice deferred but real.
5. Identity manifest rotation/refresh mechanism unspecified; same
   path as initial registration (separate trust turn) implied but
   should be stated.

E3 status: E3-A spec, E3-B trust-bootstrap, E3-C adapter inspection,
E3-B-FIX-001 verifier hardening, E3-D adapter-selection design,
and E3-D-FIX-001 wrapper preconditions all accepted. E3 enablement
(actual adapter setup, install, MCP registration, plugin install)
remains a separate per-adapter sub-experiment requiring Sami's
explicit approval recorded in COLLAB.md.

Sami's decision queue:
- Accept E3-D-FIX-001 as filed, then choose between: authorize the
  next concrete E3 step (separate prior wrapper-codex-mcp trust
  turn); OR pivot to a queued item (Experiment 4 council skill
  pack, kit extraction toward colorado-songwriters-collective); OR
  defer further E3 work.

E3-D accepted. E3-D-FIX-001 was authorized by Sami on 2026-05-15 as
design/prose only. Explicit authorization text recorded here and in
the consultation thread:

  "Approved:
  - Accept E3-D as a successful adapter-selection design turn.
  - Authorize E3-D-FIX-001 as design/prose only.
  Scope:
  - Edit only COLLAB.md and a new E3-D-FIX-001 turn note, unless
    the agent proposes a tiny PROTOCOL.md note and stops for
    approval.
  - Address only the five E3-D critique nits:
    1. make Claude/wrapper coordinator registration explicit;
    2. choose wrapper-as-own-coordinator vs Claude-key signing;
    3. define inbound attested_by_observer semantics;
    4. define durable approval-event-before-allow ordering;
    5. define wrapper binary/source identity verification.
  - No installs, MCP registration, plugin setup, .mcp.json, bridge
    enablement, global config changes, commits, pushes, PRs,
    branches, or adapter execution.
  - Hard stop after E3-D-FIX-001 and hand off for critique."

Sami's preferred answers (Codex may agree, push back, or refine each
in writing):
- Nit 2: wrapper gets its own coordinator identity/keypair.
- Nit 3: inbound MCP responses are `attested_by_observer`, not
  Codex-signed.
- Nit 4: approval events must be durably accepted before the
  wrapper sends `allow`.
- Nit 5: wrapper source/binary identity must be verified before it
  can emit approval-related events.

Codex authored E3-D-FIX-001 (mirrors E3-B-FIX-001 authorship pattern).
Claude consultant is the next critique agent.

E3 status: E3-A spec accepted, E3-B trust-bootstrap accepted, E3-C
adapter inspection accepted, E3-B-FIX-001 verifier hardening
accepted, E3-D adapter-selection design accepted. E3-D-FIX-001 will
tighten direct-MCP wrapper preconditions before any future
enablement sub-experiment. E3 enablement (actual adapter setup,
install, MCP registration, plugin install) remains a separate
per-adapter sub-experiment requiring Sami's explicit approval
recorded in COLLAB.md.

E3-D Claude consultant critique filed (2026-05-15). Zero blockers.
Independent review endorsed: direct codex mcp-server first selection
(with Codex's correction that direct MCP is "not a risk downgrade,
just the cleaner first wrapper target"); the six-method allow-list
verbatim; the blocked-by-default surface enumeration; the
signed-event boundary; the 9-step rollback procedure (especially the
plugin-install-during-direct-MCP-rollback defensive rule); the
10-item verification evidence list; the Stop-hook isolation as a
separate sub-experiment.

Five nits flagged for future direct-MCP enablement sub-experiment
(NOT for E3-D acceptance):
1. Make Claude/wrapper coordinator registration step explicit in
   preconditions (recommend separate prior trust turn, not a
   sub-step of direct-MCP enablement).
2. Pick wrapper-coordinator identity design: transport-only using
   Claude's keys vs the wrapper as its own coordinator with
   Sami-rooted keypair. Recommend the latter for trust separation.
3. Sharpen inbound signature semantics: wrapper-observed envelopes
   must mark themselves `attested_by_observer`, not as
   Codex-signed events.
4. Document approval-timing ordering: signed approval event
   durably persisted BEFORE wrapper sends allow response BEFORE
   Codex acts.
5. Add wrapper binary identity verification (committed source hash
   or build artifact signature) before granting approval-event-
   emission capability.

Plus consultant-side answers to Codex's two structural open questions
(yes to direct-MCP first; additional blocked-method categories
enumerated for the deny list: server-initiated push, session
lifecycle, telemetry/logging).

E3 status: E3-A spec accepted, E3-B trust-bootstrap accepted, E3-C
adapter inspection accepted, E3-B-FIX-001 verifier hardening
accepted, E3-D adapter-selection design accepted. E3 enablement
(actual adapter setup, install, MCP registration, plugin install)
remains a separate per-adapter sub-experiment requiring Sami's
explicit approval recorded in COLLAB.md.

Sami's immediate decision queue:
- None while Claude's E3-D-FIX-001 critique is pending.
- Later only, if separately authorized: decide whether the next E3
  step is a wrapper-coordinator trust turn, a direct-MCP enablement
  design, Experiment 4 council skill pack work, or kit extraction
  toward colorado-songwriters-collective.

Codex filed `.agent-handoff/turns/E3-D-codex-adapter-selection.md`
as the authorized adapter-selection design-only turn. E3-D selects
direct `codex mcp-server` wrapper as the first future enablement
candidate, official Codex plugin wrapper as the second future
candidate, and keeps CCB and Claude Squad pattern-only under the
current AGPL posture. File-based handoff remains the binding
reference path.

Sami's verbatim E3-D authorization is preserved in the E3-D turn note;
it was also recorded in prior `COLLAB.md` state at commit `0a1f326`.

E3-D does not authorize any install, plugin setup, MCP registration,
`.mcp.json` edit, bridge enablement, live transport, global config
change, commit, push, PR, branch, wrapper code, or proposed-to-approved
transition. Any actual adapter enablement remains a separate
per-adapter sub-experiment requiring Sami's explicit approval recorded
in `COLLAB.md`.

E3 status: E3-A spec accepted, E3-B trust-bootstrap accepted, E3-C
adapter inspection accepted, E3-B-FIX-001 verifier hardening accepted,
and E3-D design filed for Claude critique.

E3-B Claude consultant critique filed (2026-05-15). Zero blockers.
Independent verification by the consultant passed across all checks:
`.gitignore` contains exactly `.agent-handoff/local/`; both private
keys mode 0600 and gitignored; `git check-ignore` confirms protection;
secret-leakage grep returned only filename references (no key material
outside `.agent-handoff/local/`); `node trust-bootstrap.mjs self-test`
passes (canonical_json_vector, duplicate_key_rejection,
ed25519_sign_verify); `node trust-bootstrap.mjs verify` reports `ok:
true` for registry, both events, possession_proof, hash_chain,
parent_link, prior_trust_link, and final_registry_links.

Five small nits flagged for optional future housekeeping: expand
`.gitignore` to add `.DS_Store` and `.claude/worktrees/`; future split
of `trust-bootstrap.mjs` into modules; refusal-to-overwrite test
fixture; redundant-fingerprint-in-proof storage; document
strict-integer-only payload constraint in adapter-author guide.

E3-C concurrently filed by Codex at
`.agent-handoff/turns/E3-C-codex-adapter-inspection.md` per Sami's
parallel authorization. E3-C critique by the Claude consultant was
filed and accepted with zero blockers.

E3-B trust-bootstrap implementation completed on 2026-05-15 and handed
to Claude for architecture-consultant critique. Codex created the
secret-safety `.gitignore` rule for `.agent-handoff/local/`, verified
`git check-ignore` before key generation, generated the Sami root and
Codex coordinator Ed25519 keypairs into ignored local paths, wrote the
root-signed trust registry and two root-signed bootstrap events, wrote
the Codex possession proof, and verified the registry/event/proof/hash
chain with `.agent-handoff/src/trust-bootstrap.mjs`.

E3-C concurrently authorized as read-only adapter/security inspection:
CCB (`bfly123/claude_codex_bridge`), Claude Squad, official Codex
plugin for Claude Code, and `codex mcp-server` should all get
license/config/security inspection before any bridge setup is
approved. E3-C must stay read-only and must not block E3-B.

Secret safety status: `.gitignore` contains `.agent-handoff/local/`,
`.DS_Store`, and `.claude/worktrees/`.
The private key paths `.agent-handoff/local/keys/sami-root.ed25519` and
`.agent-handoff/local/keys/codex.ed25519` are ignored, untracked, and
mode `0600`.

Single-developer per-repo Sami root key model selected for this
prototype. Org/team signing path deferred to a later design.

Private key backup is Sami's responsibility outside the repo (password
manager or encrypted local/off-machine backup).

Seven E3-A critique nits addressed in E3-B's turn note: time skew
window default, integer-only-numbers rule scope for payloads,
`recipient_coordinator_ids` broadcast semantics, `possession_proof_hash`
byte format, replay-vs-import nonce semantics, branch/force-push
policy, prompt-injection minimum baseline.

E3-A schema is endorsed: JCS-narrowed canonical JSON, Ed25519
signatures, SHA-256 hashing, UUIDv7 opaque event ids, integer-only
envelope numbers, hybrid sequence+hash filenames, domain-separation
prefix `agent-event-envelope:v1\n` for signing. Strengths called out
in the critique: domain-separation prefix prevents cross-protocol
signature reuse; `previous_accepted_event_hash` separated from
`parent_event_ids`; quarantine refuses to store hash of suspected
secret value alone; UUIDv7 treated as opaque (no timestamp trust);
fixtures cite real base commit `4543fc44...`.

E3-A was authorized by Sami on 2026-05-15. Explicit authorization text
recorded in this COLLAB.md entry and the consultation thread:

  "Run E3-A as a design-only event-envelope schema/spec turn. No
  implementation, installs, bridge enablement, commits, pushes, or
  protocol approval implied."

E3-A proposed canonical event envelope fields, deterministic JSON
serialization rules, signature coverage, trust-registry snapshot shape, file
naming conventions, quarantine rules, minimal fixture requirements, and
pass/fail acceptance checks. Design only: no code, no installs, no bridge
enablement, no commits, no protocol approval.

Concurrent decision: official Codex plugin and `codex mcp-server` paths
added to the E3-C read-only adapter/security inspection queue alongside
CCB and Claude Squad. Reason: their security/config surface is real
(approval boundaries, project/global config changes, sandbox
interactions, cross-tool context) even though their license risk
differs from third-party adapters.

Deferred per Sami: council skill pack work waits until E3-A lands;
porting to `colorado-songwriters-collective` waits until E3-B lands.
AgentBridge / CCB / plugin implementation work waits until they are
judged against E3-A's schema and governance contract; they may not
define the contract.

(E2 four-turn re-scope rhythm previously closed cleanly; all E2-006
critique blockers resolved by E2-007 and accepted by E2-008.)

`COLLAB.md` remains transitional pending the new state model.

Hard stop: E3-B implementation is complete and no further E3-B work
continues until Claude critiques it. E3-C remains separately authorized
as read-only adapter/security inspection and must not block E3-B. No
bridge enablement, installs, commits, pushes, PRs, branches, global
config changes, or proposed-to-approved transitions are authorized.

## Tool Observations

- Codex CLI is installed: `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, `codex-cli 0.130.0`.
- Claude Code is installed: `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, `2.1.58`.
- `codex mcp-server --help` works.
- `claude mcp serve --help` works.
- Claude currently has the Vercel plugin installed, but not the OpenAI Codex
  plugin.
- `claude mcp list` currently reports only a Vercel MCP entry and that health
  check fails.
- No project-level Claude MCP entry for Codex has been confirmed yet.
- Browser runner setup is Chrome-first. Do not default to Playwright.
- Chrome health checks passed: Chrome is installed and running; the Codex Chrome
  Extension is installed/enabled; the Codex Chrome native host manifest is
  correct.
- Codex Chrome connector smoke verification blocked direct `file://`
  navigation by URL policy, so turn 004 used an explicit local static server at
  `http://localhost:8765/app/index.html` and stopped it after verification.
- `denver-songwriters-collective` is the old repo name. Use
  `colorado-songwriters-collective` for current sibling-repo references.
- Ubicloud runner clarification: the CI runner provider is Ubicloud. The
  console project is `pj0qdnp2x6fp4q5p24j13cqv81`; the console shows the
  `samiserrag` GitHub integration and no active runners at setup time.
- GitHub repository verified as `samiserrag/Claude-Codex`, private, default
  branch `main`.

## E1 Historical Constraints / Still-Active Approval Stopgates

- Do not install dependencies without Sami's explicit approval.
- Do not commit, push, merge, or create a PR without Sami's explicit approval.
- Do not use dangerous sandbox or approval-bypass modes.
- Do not modify global Claude/Codex config without Sami's explicit approval.
- Stop after the four Experiment 1 turn notes unless Sami says to continue.

## E1 Historical Decisions Made

- Use repo files as the source of truth for collaboration state.
- Use a no-dependency static web app as the sample project.
- Use append-only turn notes to avoid both agents rewriting the same history.
- Run Experiment 1 file-based only. Do not use an MCP/plugin bridge in the
  first loop.
- Limit Experiment 1 to one feature: add a decision, persist it to
  localStorage, and verify reload preservation.
- Stop Experiment 1 after four turn notes: 001 Claude architecture, 002 Codex
  critique, 003 Claude implementation, 004 Codex implementation + smoke.
- Use Chrome-based browser runners for validation: Codex Chrome connector for
  Codex and Claude in Chrome MCP for Claude Code.
- Use Ubicloud for GitHub Actions CI via `runs-on: ubicloud-standard-2`.

## E1 Historical Considered And Rejected

- Rejected a dependency-heavy app because setup noise would obscure the workflow
  test.
- Rejected a fully free-running loop as the first test because approval and
  context boundaries need to be observed before automation is trusted.
- Rejected bridge use in Experiment 1 because the file-based contract needs a
  baseline before MCP/plugin routing is evaluated.
- Rejected implementing the full Decision Ledger feature list in Experiment 1
  because scope noise would obscure whether the collaboration loop works.

## E1 Historical Proposed File Ownership

- Claude owns turn 001 architecture, `app/index.html`, and first-pass
  `app/styles.css`.
- Codex owns turn 002 critique, `app/app.js`, and Chrome smoke evidence.
- Both agents may update `.agent-handoff/COLLAB.md` and add turn notes.
- Neither agent should edit another agent's existing turn note.
- Experiment 1 no-touch files after this setup pass: `.github/`, `.claude/`,
  `docs/`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.agent-handoff/PROTOCOL.md`.

  consultant critique before further E3 work.

## Latest Claude Response

E2-007 rescope revision written at
`.agent-handoff/turns/E2-007-claude-rescope-revision.md` accepting all
three E2-006 blockers. (1) E2-001 §3 split into binding reference path
(Tier 0 manual handoff + Tier 1 inbox/outbox file exchange) and
exploratory opt-in adapters (Tier 2 cron, Tier 3 webhooks, AgentBridge,
CCB, tmux variants, official Codex plugin, `codex mcp-server`). External
transports replace delivery mechanics but not the durable signed
envelope, import validation, quarantine, audit log, or human-readable
fallback. (2) Experiment 3 reordered: E3-A event-envelope schema/spec
(design only: canonical envelope fields, JSON serialization, signature
coverage, registry snapshot shape, file naming, fixtures, acceptance
checks), then E3-B trust-bootstrap implementation against the binding
reference path only, with E3-C adapter evaluation (read-only license
inspection on CCB and Claude Squad, plus read-only evaluation of
AgentBridge, CCB, tmux variants, official Codex plugin and
`codex mcp-server`) running in parallel, followed by E3-D Sami adapter
selection per scoped sub-experiment. (3) Transport-choice matrix now
includes official Codex plugin in Claude Code and `codex mcp-server`
project-scoped MCP entry alongside AgentBridge, CCB, tmux variants, and
the file-based default. The LLM Council adoption moved out of
Experiment 3 to a separate future council experiment. All five E2-006
nits addressed in writing (deferred housekeeping for Phase enum,
sub-decision count alignment, council API-key tradeoff, Codex Mate /
Ruflo control-plane read, stale "Original Hard-Stop Note" cleanup).

## Earlier Claude Response

E2-005 re-scope written at `.agent-handoff/turns/E2-005-claude-rescope.md`
after round-3 prior-art consultation. Narrowed E2 to governance-only
and deferred transport+council to Experiment 3. Codex E2-006 critique
identified three blockers: §3 over-demoted, missing schema gate before
trust bootstrap, missing Codex-plugin/mcp-server in transport matrix.
All three accepted and addressed by E2-007.

## Latest Codex Response

E3-D-FIX-001 wrapper-preconditions fix turn written at
`.agent-handoff/turns/E3-D-FIX-001-codex-wrapper-preconditions.md`.
Codex accepted the five E3-D critique nits as real preconditions for
any future direct-MCP enablement. The fix recommends a separate prior
trust turn for `wrapper-codex-mcp` registration, chooses
wrapper-as-own-coordinator with its own Sami-rooted keypair, defines
inbound Codex MCP output as wrapper-signed `attested_by_observer`
payloads rather than Codex-signed claims, specifies durable accepted
approval event before MCP `allow`, and requires wrapper source/binary
identity verification before approval-related event emission.

Codex did not edit PROTOCOL.md. Any wrapper-observed payload fields,
identity-manifest payload contract, or future event-kind cleanup remain
proposed for later Sami-approved scope. No adapter was enabled. No
install, MCP registration, plugin setup, `.mcp.json` edit, bridge
enablement, live transport, global config change, code, wrapper
implementation, git operation, or proposed-to-approved transition was
performed.

## Earlier Codex Response

Turn 002 critique written at `.agent-handoff/turns/002-codex-critique.md`.
Codex accepts the Experiment 1 scope, bare-array `localStorage` shape, ID rule,
DOM contract, and hardcoded `"proposed"` status. Codex listed one blocker:
write-failure behavior must not render or treat a new decision as saved when
`localStorage.setItem` fails, because that would violate the reload-preserves
promise. The required correction is to attempt the storage write against a
candidate list first, then update in-memory state and render only after the
write succeeds. Nits cover ARIA linkage, locale timestamp rendering, and
keeping parse-failure recovery simple.

## Questions Requiring Sami Approval

- None immediate while Claude's E3-D-FIX-001 critique is pending.
- Later only, if separately authorized: should
  `wrapper-codex-mcp` be registered in a separate trust turn?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should direct `codex mcp-server`
  wrapper be approved as the first adapter enablement sub-experiment?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we register `codex mcp-server`
  as a project-scoped Claude MCP server?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we install the official OpenAI
  Codex plugin in Claude Code as the second adapter candidate?
- Later only, if separately authorized: should we register `claude mcp serve`
  inside Codex for the reverse-direction experiment?

## Next Request To Claude

Perform the E3-D-FIX-001 architecture-consultant critique of
`.agent-handoff/turns/E3-D-FIX-001-codex-wrapper-preconditions.md`.
Focus on whether the fix adequately resolves the five E3-D nits:
separate wrapper coordinator registration, wrapper-owned identity/keypair,
inbound `attested_by_observer` semantics, durable approval-event-before-allow
ordering, and wrapper source/binary identity verification. Stay read-only.
Do not implement, install dependencies, enable bridges, register MCP, edit
`.mcp.json`, modify global config, commit, push, open a PR, create a branch,
delete files, or treat any proposal as approved.

## Next Request To Codex

None active. Hard stop after E3-D-FIX-001 until Claude's critique is filed and
Sami explicitly authorizes any next scope.

## Next Request To Sami

None immediate unless you want to redirect the experiment. The next expected
action is Claude's E3-D-FIX-001 critique.
